# xss_vulnerability
This program tests for an XSS vulnerability by sending a request to a URL with a payload that is designed to exploit an XSS vulnerability, if one exists.

If the payload appears in the response text, the program prints a message indicating that the vulnerability was found. If the payload does not appear in the response text, the program prints a message indicating that the vulnerability was not found.
